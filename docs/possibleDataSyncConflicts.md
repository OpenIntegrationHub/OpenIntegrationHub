## Simultaneous Changes in different Systems

**Problem**:

- Two systems change a specific value of a given dataset at the same time
  - In this case `same time` can also mean inbetween two flow executions (polling flow)

**Assumption:**

- It is possible to updated a dataset partially e.g. at some point a comparison of the old and updated dataset takes place. Instead of the whole dataset only new values are updated.

_Note:_ If a partial update is not possible changes 3 & 4 (described in the following) also lead to conflicts.

**Example:**

_Original Dataset:_

|firstName|lastName|Phone|Company|
|---|---|---|---|
|John|Doe|+12 345 678|Alpha Company|

1. System A changes `company` to `beta company`
2. System B changes `company` to `delta company`
3. System A changes `phone` to `+98 765 432 1`
4. System B changes `lastName` to `Foo`

Changes 3 & 4 only changes values in one of the system, so there is no conflict.

Canges 1 & 2 are changes on the same value of the dataset. The subsequent question is:

_Which dataset should be stored?_

### Solution Strategies Simultaneous Changes

1. First-Writer-Wins: The first change is propagated. `First` can be determined in different ways e.g. by comparing _lastChanged_ timestamps (granulartity of timestamps must be considered) or taking the dataset that is first propagated to the hub
   1. All following changes must be discarded and somehow handled (e.g. response to source system)
2. Last-Writer-Wins: The last change is propagated. `Last` can be determined in different ways e.g. by comparing _lastChanged_ timestamps (granulartity of timestamps must be considered)  or taking the dataset that is last propagated to the hub.
3. One of the systems is declared to be the `master`. Thus, the `master` systems record is propagated.
4. Manual Intervention: Operations stuff has to resolve the conflict.
5. Logging Conflicts: Conflicts can be qirten on a queue (Some sort of resolution software could attempt to resolve the conflicts automatically. For conflicts that couldn't be resolved option **4** could be used).

For distributed systems without usage of a data storage it is possible to use a vector clock in order to secure sequential processing of the changes.

## Changes on a dataset that does not exist

**Problem:**

- System A deletes a certain dataset but is not able to propagate the deletion due to missing mechanisms.
- System B updates this certain dataset and propagates the dataset via the OIH. When the command to update the record is run on system A, thereâ€™s a conflict. The command intstructs system A to change a non-existent dataset.

### Solution Strategies Changes on non-existent dataset

## Circular Updates

**Problem:**

1. User changes a value of dataset X in system A
2. Connector of system A fetches new and updated data on the basis of a last modified timestamp
3. Dataset X is propagated via the OIH to other (listening) services (For this example for reasons of simplicity only to system B)
4. Dataset X is updated in System B and last modified in system B is updated
5. Connector of system B fetches new and updated data n the basis of a last modified timestamp
6. Dataset X is propagated via the OIH to other (listening) services (This list includes A)
7. **Start again with step 1**
8. ...

These circular updates lead to a loop. The subsequent question is:

_How to prevent such loops?_

### Solution Strategies Circular Updates

- Central last modified timestamp within the OIH which compares the last modified timestamp of system B with OIH last timestamp (depending on timestamp granularity the timestamps could differ and loop still occurs)
  - Optionally compare the incoming dataset to the one stored in the datahub and decide if a sync is needed
- Additionally store a value for `last modified by` to prevent OIH updates to be propagated multiple times (e.g. _if lastModified equals OIh, ignore the change_)
  - Disadvantage: Changes made by an end user in the target system are not recognized in certain cases e.g. end user updates dataset X (lastModified and modifier updated) --> OIH sends update for dataset X (lastModified and modifier updated) --> connectors polls for new and updated data.
- Implement a sync flag for changes made by an end-user. This ensures that changes by an end-user are not overwritten. Polling trigger could fetch for lastModified and syncFlag === true.
  - Requires the target system to implement a syncFlac column
  - Requires the target systems API to provide a filter for syncFlag field#

## Handling Denied Responses

**Problem:**

- An update is made on dataset X in system A
- An update is made on dataset X in system B
- The update of system A is propagated via OIH
- Now several options are possible:

**Two Options:**

1. If its an state based approach its an `dirty read`. Means: System B read an outdated dataset and made changes to this dataset.
   1. Either system B is able to discard its own changes (or merge if no conflicts occured) or
   2. System B thrwows an error message `update denied because of local changes`
2. If its an operation based approach system B could process the update (if its not made on the same value or if its an realtiv operation) and now error is thrown

**Question:**

In case of 1.2: _How should OIH handle this response?_

### Solution Strategies Handling Denied Responses

- OIH could send a new `create object` event to system B so that two concurrent datasets exist in system B
- Operation based approach with relativ operation so that changes are processed
