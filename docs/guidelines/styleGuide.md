# general

## docker

Since kubernetes is the agreed container managment framework, use docker images for runtimes.

## object oriented design principles (recommendation)

General best practices should be applied to software development.

* SOLID: <https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design>
* DRY: <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%E2%80%99t_repeat_yourself>

## test driven development (recommendation)

Use tdd (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>)

## clean code / clean architecture (recommendation)

## javascript

### node.js docker

Use node.js docker images based on LTS version (currently node:carbon-alpine, node:carbon) instead of custom from scratch built containers.

* <https://hub.docker.com/_/node/>

### coding style

Use popular coding style to make the source code more intuitiv for other developers e.g. airbnb

* <https://github.com/airbnb/javascript>

### logging framework

Log should go to the standard output to be able to process it with container management. Use a logging framework to configure the logging detail  e.g. winston or bunyan

* <https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston>
* <https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunyan>

### linting

Use eslint to make code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

* <https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint>
* editorconfig can be used to ensure consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs. See <https://editorconfig.org/> for more information

### automated testing

Use automated unit testing with a code coverage of at least 80% e.g. Mocha/Chai

* <https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha>
* <https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai>

### no fuzzy versions

Dependencies declared in package.json could use a fuzzy version markup that allows installed dependencies to be flexible at the cost of deterministic builds. This can be dangerous if one of the projectâ€™s dependencies also uses fuzzy versioning, when an incompatibility is introduced in a transient dependency.
Use fixed versions for all dependencies

### rest apis (recommendation)

If a service exposes a rest api, consider using a swagger api(json prefered) and the swagger-ui code generation tools to generate a server stub.

### http assertion (testing)

To test http requests the easy way, supertest allows to do so on a high abstraction level while still providing drop down access to the lower level API
