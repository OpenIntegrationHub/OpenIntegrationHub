# Eventset and format

Suggested format for event names:  [object].[occured action]

Examples:

`flow.created`

`flow.changed`


`flow.started`

`flow.stopped`

`flow.continued`

`flow.canceled`

`flow.finished`


`flow.hasError`


When the event gets published as message it has already happend. Therefore all event names are in past-tense.
