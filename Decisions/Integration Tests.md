# Status
accepted : alternative 1

# Context

As soon as we are building, deploying services we need integration tests to make sure services/flows are working seamlessly together   

# Alternative 1: JEST
Stats (12.11.2018)
- Github: 3,784 commits, 142 releases, 838 contributors, 468 issues
- npm downloads: 22mio (2017) -> 64mio (2018), g ≈ 1.9 p.a.

## pro 
- open source 
- faster/easier than mocha because built-in mocking/assertion/spy/mocking libraries --> works out of the box!
- runs tests concurrently
- generate code coverage reports
- already used for OIH IAM & SKM
- fast growing user base

## contra 
- less configuration possibilities than mocha
- less docu/community (mocha is more mature)

## Consequences


# Alternative 2: MOCHA
Stats (12.11.2018)
- Github: 2,994 commits, 142 releases, 389 contributors, 255 issues
- npm downloads: 67mio (2017) -> 79mio (2018), g ≈ 0,19 p.a.

## pro
- flexible and extendable with assertion
- mocking and spy libraries
- larger community 
- better documentation: more plugins/extensions for usage scenarios

## contra
- libraries need setup and configuration first
   - chai (as assertion lib)
   - Sinon (mocking)
   - spying etc

# Decision
- As discussed in the weekly backlog meeting (15.11.2018), we agreed on using Jest for the integration tests
